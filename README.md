# Xaml-Island-WPF

Xaml-Island-WPF is an experimental repository demonstrating the use of XAML Islands inside a WPF application. XAML Islands allow modern WinUI XAML controls to be hosted in classic desktop applications (WPF, WinForms) to take advantage of newer UI controls.

This project is intended as a proof-of-concept and learning resource rather than a production-ready template.
